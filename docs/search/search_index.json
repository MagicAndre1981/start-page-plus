And it's open source!\n\n\nTo open the new \nStart Page+\n window:\n\n\n\n\nmake sure Visual Studio's \nStart Window\n is disabled\n\n\n\n\nin \nTools\n | \nOptions\n | \nEnvironment\n | \nStartup\n select \nEmpty Environment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nselect \nView\n | \nStart Page+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Start Page+ window is accessed from the \nView\n menu, because it makes sense.\nIt's also easy to remember because you think \"I want to \nview\n the start page\",\nyou don't think \"I want to \nfile\n the start page.\n\n\nThe Visual Studio 2010-2017's \nStart Page\n was always in the \nView\n menu,\nuntil Microsoft moved it to the \nFile\n menu, which never made any sense.\n\n\nSupport the Project\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf \nStart Page+\n has saved you time and hassle, please come back and show your support:\n\n\n\n\nyou could \nrate \nStart Page+\n (only takes a couple of seconds)\n\n\nor \nreview \nStart Page+\n (help others benefit from your experience)\n\n\nor \nshout me a coke\n (I don't drink coffee or beer lol)",
