Please understand that this is a **preview release**.

While the features of the _Start Tab_ are _functional_ in this preview (I'm using it myself),
there are still some quirks that need to be ironed out, plus a number of missing features that still
need to be added.
I just wanted to get this up to the marketplace as quickly as I could, so people can see it and
start to use it.

**Feedback is welcome**, however **don't** add your ideas and/or feeback to any forum post where you might have
discovered _Start Page+_, please use the [GitHub Issues][github-issues-url] page.
I won't be able to address your feedback in any forum posts, as it's not fair to people to have posts highjacked.

Please consult the [Roadmap][roadmap-url] page, or the [GitHub Issues][github-issues-url] page
**before** you add an issue for new features, feature enhancements etc.
If you don't see your desired feature or enhancement mentioned on the website,
then by all means go ahead and add an issue for it.

Please consult the _Start Page+_ website's [Known Issues][website-url] page,
or the [GitHub Issues][github-issues-url] page before adding issues for any bugs you may have discovered.
Duplicate _issues_ just waste everyone's time.

The _Favorites_ tab, the _Create_ tab, and the _News_ tab are **still being worked on**.

## Bring Back Start Page!

When Visual Studio 2019 was released, many developers were dismayed to find that the _Start Page_ had been completely
replaced by the new _Start Window_ (a big **modal** dialog window, with no room for _Developer News_).

## Introducing Start Page+

So many of you, in **so many posts** in the [Developer Community forum][developer-community-forum-url], **pleaded** for Microsoft to bring back the Visual Studio 2017
_Start Page_, and unfortunately those pleas have fallen on deaf ears.

[developer-community-forum-url]: https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/search.html?f=&type=question+OR+problem+OR+idea&type=question+OR+problem+OR+idea&c=&redirect=search%2Fsearch&sort=relevance&q=start+page

Well, you asked and now _Start Page+_ delivers!

The [Start Page+][start-page-plus-url] extension adds a new start page that is a **dockable tool window**,
not a **modal window**.
It's been written **from the ground up**, and doesn't rely on any of Visual Studio's *internal* code.
So it can't be taken  away by Microsoft. And it's open source!

To open the new _Start Page+_ window:

- make sure Visual Studio's *Start Window* is disabled
    - in **Tools** | **Options** | **Environment** | **Startup** select _Empty Environment_

    ![Startup Options](https://github.com/luminous-software/extension-name/raw/master/docs/assets/images/startup-options.png)

- click on **View** | **Start Page+**

  ![Start Page+](https://github.com/luminous-software/extension-name/raw/master/docs/assets/images/start-page-plus.png)

The _Start Page+_ window is accessed from the **View** menu, because it makes sense.
It's also easy to remember because you think "I want to **view** the start page",
you don't think "I want to **file** the start page.

The Visual Studio 2010-2017's _Start Page_ was always in the **View** menu,
until Microsoft moved it to the **File** menu in later versions of VS 2017, and then permanently in VS 2019,
which never really made **any** sense.
