## Bring Back Start Page!

When Visual Studio 2019 was released, many developers were dismayed to find that the _Start Page_ had been completely
replaced by the new _Start Window_ (a big **modal** dialog window, with no room for _Developer News_).

## Introducing Start Page+

So many of you, in **so many posts** in the Developer forum, **pleaded** for Microsoft to bring back the Visual Studio 2017
_Start Page_, and unfortunately those please fell on deaf ears.

Well, you asked and now _Start Page+_ delivers!

The [Start Page+][start-page-plus-url] extension adds a new *Start Page* that is a **dockable tool window**,
not a **modal** window.
It's been written **from the ground up**, and doesn't rely on any of Visual Studio's *internal* code.
So it can't be taken  away by Microsoft. And it's open source!

To open the new _Start Page+_ window:

- make sure Visual Studio's *Start Window* is disabled
  - in **Tools** | **Options** | **Environment** | **Startup** select _Empty Environment_

    ![Startup Options](docs-source/assets/images/startup-options.png)

- select **View** | **Start Page+**

The Start Page+ window is accessed from the **View** menu, because it makes sense.
It's also easy to remember because you think "I want to **view** the start page",
you don't think "I want to **file** the start page.

The Visual Studio 2010-2017's _Start Page_ was always in the **View** menu,
until Microsoft moved it to the **File** menu, which never made any sense.
